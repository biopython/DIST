<EM>Why doesn&#X2019;t</EM> <CODE>Bio.SeqIO</CODE> <EM>work? It imports fine but there is no parse function etc.</EM>
You need Biopython 1.43 or later. Older versions did contain some related code under the <CODE>Bio.SeqIO</CODE> name which has since been deprecated - and this is why the import &#X201C;works&#X201D;.</LI><LI CLASS="li-enumerate"><EM>Why doesn&#X2019;t</EM> <CODE>Bio.Blast</CODE> <EM>work with the latest plain text NCBI blast output?</EM>
The NCBI keep tweaking the plain text output from the BLAST tools, and keeping our parser up to date is an ongoing struggle. We recommend you to use the XML output instead, which is designed to be read by a computer program.</LI><LI CLASS="li-enumerate"><EM>I looked in a directory for code, but I couldn&#X2019;t seem to find the code that does something. Where&#X2019;s it hidden?</EM><BR>
 One thing to know is that we put code in <CODE>__init__.py</CODE> files. If you are not used to looking for code in this file this can be confusing. The reason we do this is to make the imports easier for users.

All of the examples in this section assume that you have some general working knowledge of python, and that you have successfully installed Biopython on your system. If you think you need to brush up on your python, the main python web site provides quite a bit of free documentation to get started with (<A HREF="http://www.python.org/doc/"><TT>http://www.python.org/doc/</TT></A>). </P><P>Since much biological work on the computer involves connecting with databases on the internet, some of the examples will also require a working internet connection in order to run. </P><P>Now that that is all out of the way, let&#X2019;s get into what we can do with Biopython.</P><!--TOC section General overview of what Biopython provides-->
<H2 CLASS="section"><!--SEC ANCHOR --><A NAME="htoc7">2.1</A>&#XA0;&#XA0;General overview of what Biopython provides</H2><!--SEC END --><P>As mentioned in the introduction, Biopython is a set of libraries to provide the ability to deal with &#X201D;things&#X201D; of interest to biologists working on the computer. In general this means that you will need to have at least some programming experience (in python, of course!) or at least an interest in learning to program. Biopython&#X2019;s job is to make your job easier as a programmer by supplying reusable libraries so that you can focus on answering your specific question of interest, instead of focusing on the internals of parsing a particular file format (of course, if you want to help by writing a parser that doesn&#X2019;t exist and contributing it to Biopython, please go ahead!). So Biopython&#X2019;s job is to make you happy!</P><P>One thing to note about Biopython is that it often provides multiple ways of &#X201C;doing the same thing.&#X201D; To me, this can be frustrating since I often way to just know the one right way to do something. However, this is also a real benefit because it gives you lots of flexibility and control over the libraries. The tutorial helps to show you the common or easy ways to do things so that you can just make things work. To learn more about the alternative possibilities, look into the Cookbook section (which tells you some cools tricks and tips) and the Advanced section (which provides you with as much detail as you&#X2019;d ever want to know!). </P><!--TOC section Working with sequences-->

<A NAME="sec:sequences"></A></P><P>Disputedly (of course!), the central object in bioinformatics is the sequence. Thus, we&#X2019;ll start with a quick introduction to the Biopython mechanisms for dealing with sequences, the <CODE>Seq</CODE> object, which we&#X2019;ll discuss in more detail in Chapter&#XA0;<A HREF="#seq:sequence-chapter">3</A>.</P><P>Most of the time when we think about sequences we have in my mind a string of letters like <CODE>'AGTACACTGGT'</CODE>. You can create such <CODE>Seq</CODE> object with this sequence as follows - the &#X201C;&gt;&gt;&gt;&#X201D; represents the python prompt followed by what you would type in:</P><PRE CLASS="verbatim">&gt;&gt;&gt; from Bio.Seq import Seq
&gt;&gt;&gt; my_seq = Seq("AGTACACTGGT")
&gt;&gt;&gt; my_seq.alphabet
Alphabet()
&gt;&gt;&gt; print my_seq.tostring()
AGTACACTGGT
</PRE><P>What we have here is a sequence object with a generic alphabet - reflecting the fact we have specified if this is a DNA or protein sequence (okay, a protein with a lot of Alanines, Glycines, Cysteines and Threonines!). We&#X2019;ll talk more about alphabets in Chapter&#XA0;<A HREF="#seq:sequence-chapter">3</A>.</P><P>In addition to having an alphabet, the <CODE>Seq</CODE> object differs from the python string in the methods it supports. You can&#X2019;t do this with a plain string:</P><PRE CLASS="verbatim">&gt;&gt;&gt; my_seq
Seq('AGTACACTGGT', Alphabet())
&gt;&gt;&gt; my_seq.complement()
Seq('TCATGTGACCA', Alphabet())
&gt;&gt;&gt; my_seq.reverse_complement()
Seq('ACCAGTGTACT', Alphabet())
</PRE><P>The next most important class is the <CODE>SeqRecord</CODE> or Sequence Record. This holds a sequence with additional annotation including an identifier, name and description. The <CODE>Bio.SeqIO</CODE> module for reading and writing sequence file formats works with <CODE>SeqRecord</CODE> objects, which will be introduced below and cover in more detail by Chapter&#XA0;<A HREF="#sec:SeqIO">4</A>.</P><P>This covers the basic features and uses of the Biopython sequence class. There is a more detailed description of the design ideas behind the sequence class in the Advanced section of this tutorial. This class is still under development and comments on the design and use are, of course, very welcome. Now that you&#X2019;ve got some idea of what it is like to interact with the Biopython libraries, it&#X2019;s time to delve into the fun, fun world of dealing with biological file formats!</P><!--TOC section A usage example-->

<A NAME="sec:orchids"></A></P><P>Before we jump right into parsers and everything else to do with Biopython, let&#X2019;s set up an example to motivate everything we do and make life more interesting. After all, if there wasn&#X2019;t any biology in this tutorial, why would you want you read it?</P><P>Since I love plants, I think we&#X2019;re just going to have to have a plant based example (sorry to all the fans of other organisms out there!). Having just completed a recent trip to our local greenhouse, we&#X2019;ve suddenly developed an incredible obsession with Lady Slipper Orchids (if you wonder why, have a look at some <A HREF="http://www.flickr.com/search/?q=lady+slipper+orchid&s=int&z=t">Lady Slipper Orchids photos on Flickr</A>, or try a <A HREF="http://images.google.com/images?q=lady%20slipper%20orchid">Google Image Search</A>).</P><P>Of course, orchids are not only beautiful to look at, they are also extremely interesting for people studying evolution and systematics. So let&#X2019;s suppose we&#X2019;re thinking about writing a funding proposal to do a molecular study of Lady Slipper evolution, and would like to see what kind of research has already been done and how we can add to that.</P><P>After a little bit of reading up we discover that the Lady Slipper Orchids are in the Orchidaceae family and the Cypripedioideae sub-family and are made up of 5 genera: <EM>Cypripedium</EM>, <EM>Paphiopedilum</EM>, <EM>Phragmipedium</EM>, <EM>Selenipedium</EM> and <EM>Mexipedium</EM>.</P><P>That gives us enough to get started delving for more information. So, let&#X2019;s look at how the Biopython tools can help us. We&#X2019;ll start with sequence parsing in Section&#XA0;<A HREF="#sec:sequence-parsing">2.4</A>, but the orchids will be back later on as well - for example we&#X2019;ll extra data from Swiss-Prot from certain orchid proteins in Section&#XA0;<A HREF="#sec:swiss_prot">6.1</A>, search PubMed for papers about orchids in Section&#XA0;<A HREF="#sec:pub_med">6.2</A>, extract sequence data from GenBank in Section&#XA0;<A HREF="#genbank-retrieval">6.3.1</A>, and work with ClustalW multiple sequence alignments of orchid proteins in Section&#XA0;<A HREF="#sec:align_clustal">6.4.1</A>.</P><!--TOC section Parsing sequence file formats-->

<A NAME="sec:sequence-parsing"></A></P><P>A large part of much bioinformatics work involves dealing with the many types of file formats designed to hold biological data. These files are loaded with interesting biological data, and a special challenge is parsing these files into a format so that you can manipulate them with some kind of programming language. However the task of parsing these files can be frustrated by the fact that the formats can change quite regularly, and that formats may contain small subtleties which can break even the most well designed parsers. </P><P>We are going to briefly introduce the <CODE>Bio.SeqIO</CODE> module, available in Biopython 1.43 and later. If you are using an older version of Biopython we encourage you to update (or find an old edition of this tutorial!). You can find out more in Chapter&#XA0;<A HREF="#sec:SeqIO">4</A>.</P><P>We&#X2019;ll start with an online search for our friends, the lady slipper orchids.

<A NAME="sec:connecting-with-biological-databases"></A></P><P>One of the very common things that you need to do in bioinformatics is extract information from biological databases. It can be quite tedious to access these databases manually, especially if you have a lot of repetitive work to do. Biopython attempts to save you time and energy by making some on-line databases available from python scripts. Currently, Biopython has code to extract information from the following databases:</P><UL CLASS="itemize"><LI CLASS="li-itemize">
<A HREF="http://www.expasy.org/">ExPASy</A> &#X2013; See section&#XA0;<A HREF="#sec:swiss_prot">6.1</A> in the Cookbook for more information.
</LI><LI CLASS="li-itemize"><A HREF="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Entrez/">Entrez from NCBI</A> &#X2013; See below
</LI><LI CLASS="li-itemize"><A HREF="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/PubMed/">PubMed from NCBI</A> &#X2013; See section&#XA0;<A HREF="#sec:pub_med">6.2</A> in the Cookbook for example code detailing how to use this.
</LI><LI CLASS="li-itemize"><A HREF="http://scop.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/scop/">SCOP</A>
</LI></UL><P>The code is these modules basically makes it easy to write python code that interact with the CGI scripts on these pages, so that you can get results in an easy to deal with format. In some cases, the results can be tightly integrated with the Biopython parsers to make it even easier to extract information.</P><P>Here we&#X2019;ll show a simple example of performing a remote Entrez query. More information on the other services is available in the Cookbook, which begins on page&#XA0;<A HREF="#sec:cookbook">??</A>.</P><P>In section&#XA0;<A HREF="#sec:orchids">2.3</A> of the parsing examples, we talked about using Entrez website to search the NCBI nucleotide databases for info on Cypripedioideae, our friends the lady slipper orchids. Now, we&#X2019;ll look at how to automate that process using a python script. For Entrez searching, this is more useful for displaying results then as a tool for getting sequences. The NCBI web site is mostly set up to allow remote queries so that you could write our own local CGI scripts that return information from NCBI pages. For this reason, the results are returned as HTML and it is pretty tough to get a flat file in a quick manner.</P><P>In this example, we&#X2019;ll just show how to connect, get the results, and display them in a web browser. First, we&#X2019;ll start by defining our search and how to display the results:</P><PRE CLASS="verbatim">search_command = 'Search'
search_database = 'Nucleotide'
return_format = 'FASTA'
search_term = 'Cypripedioideae'

my_browser = 'lynx'
</PRE><P>The first four terms define the search we are going to do. To use the Entrez module, you&#X2019;ll need to know a bit about how the remote CGI scripts at NCBI work, and you can find out more about this at <A HREF="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query/static/linking.html"><TT>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query/static/linking.html</TT></A>. The final term just describes the browser to display the results in.</P><P>Now that we&#X2019;ve got this all set up, we can query Entrez and get a handle with the results. This is done with the following code:</P><PRE CLASS="verbatim">from Bio.WWW import NCBI

result_handle = NCBI.query(search_command, search_database, term = search_term,
                           doptcmdl = return_format)
</PRE><P>The query function does all of the work of preparing the CGI script command line and rounding up the HTML results.</P><P>Now that we&#X2019;ve got the results, we are ready to save them to a file and display them in our browser, which we can do with code like:</P><PRE CLASS="verbatim">import os

result_file_name = os.path.join(os.getcwd(), "results.html")
result_file = open(result_file_name, "w")
result_file.write(result_handle.read())
result_file.close()

if my_browser == "lynx":
    os.system("lynx -force_html " + result_file_name)
elif my_browser == "netscape":
    os.system("netscape file:" + result_file_name)
</PRE><P>Snazzy! We can fetch things and display them automatically &#X2013; you could use this to quickly set up searches that you want to repeat on a daily basis and check by hand, or to set up a small CGI script to do queries and locally save the results before displaying them (as a kind of lab notebook of our search results). Hopefully whatever your task, the database connectivity code will make things lots easier for you!</P><!--TOC section What to do next-->

<H2 CLASS="section"><!--SEC ANCHOR --><A NAME="htoc17">3.1</A>&#XA0;&#XA0;Sequences and Alphabets</H2><!--SEC END --><P>The alphabet object is perhaps the important thing that makes the <CODE>Seq</CODE> object more than just a string. The currently available alphabets for Biopython are defined in the <CODE>Bio.Alphabet</CODE> module. We&#X2019;ll use the IUPAC alphabets (<A HREF="http://www.chem.qmw.ac.uk/iupac/"><TT>http://www.chem.qmw.ac.uk/iupac/</TT></A>) here to deal with some of our favorite objects: DNA, RNA and Proteins. </P><P><CODE>Bio.Alphabet.IUPAC</CODE> provides basic definitions for proteins, DNA and RNA, but additionally provides the ability to extend and customize the basic definitions. For instance, for proteins, there is a basic IUPACProtein class, but there is an additional ExtendedIUPACProtein class providing for the additional elements &#X201C;Asx&#X201D; (asparagine or aspartic acid), &#X201C;Sec&#X201D; (selenocysteine), and &#X201C;Glx&#X201D; (glutamine or glutamic acid). For DNA you&#X2019;ve got choices of IUPACUnambiguousDNA, which provides for just the basic letters, IUPACAmbiguousDNA (which provides for ambiguity letters for every possible situation) and ExtendedIUPACDNA, which allows letters for modified bases. Similarly, RNA can be represented by IUPACAmbiguousRNA or IUPACUnambiguousRNA.</P><P>The advantages of having an alphabet class are two fold. First, this gives an idea of the type of information the Seq object contains. Secondly, this provides a means of constraining the information, as a means of type checking.</P><P>Now that we know what we are dealing with, let&#X2019;s look at how to utilize this class to do interesting work.
You can create an ambiguous sequence with the default generic alphabet like this:</P><PRE CLASS="verbatim">&gt;&gt;&gt; from Bio.Seq import Seq
&gt;&gt;&gt; my_seq = Seq("AGTACACTGGT")
&gt;&gt;&gt; my_seq
Seq('AGTACACTGGT', Alphabet())
&gt;&gt;&gt; my_seq.alphabet
Alphabet()
</PRE><P>However, where possible you should specify the alphabet explicitly when creating your sequence objects - in this case an unambiguous DNA alphabet object:</P><PRE CLASS="verbatim">&gt;&gt;&gt; from Bio.Seq import Seq

&gt;&gt;&gt; my_seq = Seq('AGTACACTGGT', IUPAC.unambiguous_dna)

<H2 CLASS="section"><!--SEC ANCHOR --><A NAME="htoc18">3.2</A>&#XA0;&#XA0;Sequences act like strings</H2><!--SEC END --><P>In many ways, we can deal with Seq objects as if they were normal python strings, for example getting the length, or iterating over the elements:</P><PRE CLASS="verbatim">from Bio.Seq import Seq

&gt;&gt;&gt; print my_seq[2] #third element
&gt;&gt;&gt; print my_seq[-1] #list element

<H2 CLASS="section"><!--SEC ANCHOR --><A NAME="htoc19">3.3</A>&#XA0;&#XA0;Slicing a sequence</H2><!--SEC END --><P>A more complicated example, let&#X2019;s get a slice of the sequence:</P><PRE CLASS="verbatim">&gt;&gt;&gt; my_seq[4:12]
Seq('GATGGGCC', IUPACUnambiguousDNA())
</PRE><P>Two things are interesting to note. First, this follows the normal conventions for python strings. So the first element of the sequence is 0 (which is normal for computer science, but not so normal for biology). When you do a slice the first item is included (i.&#XA0;e.&#XA0;4 in this case) and the last is excluded (12 in this case), which is the way things work in python, but of course not necessarily the way everyone in the world would expect. The main goal is to stay consistent with what python does.</P><P>The second thing to notice is that the slice is performed on the sequence data string, but the new object produced is another <CODE>Seq</CODE> object which retains the alphabet information from the original <CODE>Seq</CODE> object.</P><P>Also like a python string, you can do slices with a start, stop and <EM>stride</EM> (the step size, which defaults to one). For example, we can get the first, second and third codon positions of this DNA sequence:</P><PRE CLASS="verbatim">&gt;&gt;&gt; my_seq[0::3]

&gt;&gt;&gt; my_seq[1::3]
Seq('AGGCATGCATC', IUPACUnambiguousDNA())
&gt;&gt;&gt; my_seq[2::3]
Seq('TAGCTAAGAC', IUPACUnambiguousDNA())
</PRE><P>Another stride trick you might have seen with a python string is the use of a -1 stride to reverse the string. You can do this with a <CODE>Seq</CODE> object too:</P><PRE CLASS="verbatim">&gt;&gt;&gt; my_seq[::-1]
Seq('CGCTAAAAGCTAGGATATATCCGGGTAGCTAG', IUPACUnambiguousDNA())

<H2 CLASS="section"><!--SEC ANCHOR --><A NAME="htoc24">3.7</A>&#XA0;&#XA0;Transcribing and Translation</H2><!--SEC END --><P>Now that the nature of the sequence object makes some sense, the next
thing to look at is what kind of things we can do with a sequence. The
<CODE>Bio</CODE> directory contains two useful modules to transcribe and
translate a sequence object. These tools work based on the alphabet of
the sequence.</P><P>For instance, let&#X2019;s supposed we want to transcribe a DNA sequence:</P><PRE CLASS="verbatim">&gt;&gt;&gt; from Bio.Seq import Seq
&gt;&gt;&gt; from Bio.Alphabet import IUPAC
&gt;&gt;&gt; my_seq = Seq("GATCGATGGGCCTATATAGGATCGAAAATCGC", IUPAC.unambiguous_dna)
</PRE><P>This contains an unambiguous alphabet, so to transcribe we would do the following:</P><PRE CLASS="verbatim">&gt;&gt;&gt; from Bio import Transcribe
&gt;&gt;&gt; transcriber = Transcribe.unambiguous_transcriber
&gt;&gt;&gt; my_rna_seq = transcriber.transcribe(my_seq)
&gt;&gt;&gt; print my_rna_seq
Seq('GAUCGAUGGGCCUAUAUAGGAUCGAAAAUCGC', IUPACUnambiguousRNA())
</PRE><P>The alphabet of the new RNA Seq object is created for free, so again, dealing with a Seq object is no more difficult then dealing with a simple string.</P><P>You can also reverse transcribe RNA sequences:</P><PRE CLASS="verbatim">&gt;&gt;&gt; transcriber.back_transcribe(my_rna_seq)
Seq('GATCGATGGGCCTATATAGGATCGAAAATCGC', IUPACUnambiguousDNA())
</PRE><P>To translate our DNA object we have quite a few choices. First, we can use any number of translation tables depending on what we know about our DNA sequence. The translation tables available in biopython were taken from information at <A HREF="ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/misc/data/gc.prt"><TT>ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/misc/data/gc.prt</TT></A>. So, you have tons of choices to pick from. For this, let&#X2019;s just focus on two choices: the Standard translation table, and the Translation table for Vertebrate Mitochondrial DNA. These tables are labeled with id numbers 1 and 2, respectively. Now that we know what tables we are looking to get, we&#X2019;re all set to perform a basic translation. First, we need to get our translators that use these tables. Since we are still dealing with our unambiguous DNA object, we want to fetch translators that take this into account:</P><PRE CLASS="verbatim">&gt;&gt;&gt; from Bio import Translate
&gt;&gt;&gt; standard_translator = Translate.unambiguous_dna_by_id[1] 
&gt;&gt;&gt; mito_translator = Translate.unambiguous_dna_by_id[2]
</PRE><P>Once we&#X2019;ve got the proper translators, it&#X2019;s time to go ahead and translate a sequence:</P><PRE CLASS="verbatim">&gt;&gt;&gt; my_seq = Seq("GCCATTGTAATGGGCCGCTGAAAGGGTGCCCGA", IUPAC.unambiguous_dna)
&gt;&gt;&gt; standard_translator.translate(my_seq)
Seq('AIVMGR*KGAR', IUPACProtein())
&gt;&gt;&gt; mito_translator.translate(my_seq)
Seq('AIVMGRWKGAR', IUPACProtein())
</PRE><P>Notice that the default translation will just go ahead and proceed blindly through a stop codon. If you are aware that you are translating some kind of open reading frame and want to just see everything up until the stop codon, this can be easily done with the <CODE>translate_to_stop</CODE> function:</P><PRE CLASS="verbatim">&gt;&gt;&gt; standard_translator.translate_to_stop(my_seq)
Seq('AIVMGR', IUPACProtein())

<H3 CLASS="subsection"><!--SEC ANCHOR --><A NAME="htoc38">4.3.2</A>&#XA0;&#XA0;Converting a file of sequences to their reverse complements</H3><!--SEC END --><P>Suppose you had a file of nucleotide sequences, and you wanted to turn it into a file containing their reverse complement sequences. This time a little bit of work is required to transform the SeqRecords we get from our input file into something suitable for saving to our output file.</P><P>To start with, we&#X2019;ll use <CODE>Bio.SeqIO.parse()</CODE> to load some nucleotide
sequences from a file, then print out their reverse complements using
the Seq object&#X2019;s built in <CODE>.reverse_complement()</CODE> method:</P><PRE CLASS="verbatim">from Bio import SeqIO

    print record.id
    print record.seq.reverse_complement().tostring()
in_handle.close()
</PRE><P>Now, if we want to save these reverse complements to a file, we&#X2019;ll need to make SeqRecord objects.
For this I think its most elegant to write our own function, where we can decide how to name our
new records:</P><PRE CLASS="verbatim">from Bio.SeqRecord import SeqRecord

def make_rc_record(record) :
    """Returns a new SeqRecord with the reverse complement sequence"""
    rc_rec = SeqRecord(seq = record.seq.reverse_complement(), \
             id = "rc_" + record.id, \
             name = "rc_" + record.name, \
             description = "reverse complement")
    return rc_rec
</PRE><P>We can then use this to turn the input records into reverse complement records ready for output. If you don&#X2019;t mind about having all the records in memory at once, then the python <CODE>map()</CODE> function is a very intuitive way of doing this:</P><PRE CLASS="verbatim">from Bio import SeqIO

in_handle = open("ls_orchid.fasta", "r")
records = map(make_rc_record, SeqIO.parse(in_handle, "fasta"))
in_handle.close()

out_handle = open("rev_comp.fasta", "w")
SeqIO.write(records, out_handle, "fasta")
out_handle.close()
</PRE><P>This is an excellent place to demonstrate the power of list comprehensions (added to Python 2.0) which in their simplest are a long-winded equivalent to using <CODE>map()</CODE>, like this:</P><PRE CLASS="verbatim">records = [make_rc_record(rec) for rec in SeqIO.parse(in_handle, "fasta")]
</PRE><P>Now list comprehensions have a nice trick up their sleaves, you can add a conditional statement:</P><PRE CLASS="verbatim">records = [make_rc_record(rec) for rec in SeqIO.parse(in_handle, "fasta") if len(rec.seq) &lt; 700]
</PRE><P>That would create an in memory list of reverse complement SeqRecords where the sequence length was under 700 base pairs. However, if you are using Python 2.4 or later, we can do exactly the same with a generator expression - but with the advantage that this does not create a list of all the records in memory at once:</P><PRE CLASS="verbatim">records = (make_rc_record(rec) for rec in SeqIO.parse(in_handle, "fasta") if len(rec.seq) &lt; 700)
</PRE><P>If you like compact code, and don&#X2019;t mind being lax about closing file handles, we can reduce this to one long line: </P><PRE CLASS="verbatim">from Bio import SeqIO
SeqIO.write((make_rc_record(rec) for rec in \
            SeqIO.parse(open("ls_orchid.fasta", "r"), "fasta") if len(rec.seq) &lt; 700), \
            open("rev_comp.fasta", "w"), "fasta")
</PRE><P>Personally, I think the above snippet of code is a little too compact, and I find the following much easier to read:</P><PRE CLASS="verbatim">from Bio import SeqIO
records = (make_rc_record(rec) for rec in \
           SeqIO.parse(open("ls_orchid.fasta", "r"), "fasta") \
           if len(rec.seq) &lt; 700)
SeqIO.write(records, open("rev_comp.fasta", "w"), "fasta")

<A NAME="sec:running-www-blast"></A></P><P>The first step in automating BLASTing is to make everything accessible
from Python scripts. So, Biopython contains code that allows you to
run the WWW version of BLAST
(<A HREF="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/"><TT>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/</TT></A>) directly from
your Python scripts. This is very nice, especially since BLAST can be
a real pain to deal with from scripts, especially with the whole BLAST
queue thing and the separate results page. Keeping the Biopython code
up to date with all of the changes at NCBI is hard enough!</P><P>The code to deal with the WWW version of BLAST is found in the
<CODE>Bio.Blast.NCBIWWW</CODE> module, and the <CODE>qblast</CODE> function. Let&#X2019;s
say we want to BLAST info we have in a FASTA formatted file against
the database. First, we need to get the info in the FASTA file. The
easiest way to do this is to use the <CODE>Bio.SeqIO</CODE> module.
In this example, we&#X2019;ll use <CODE>Bio.SeqIO.parse</CODE> to parse the FASTA file
and store the first FASTA record in the file in a SeqRecord object
(section&#XA0;<A HREF="#sec:fasta-parsing">2.4.1</A> explains <CODE>Bio.SeqIO.parse</CODE> in
more detail).</P><PRE CLASS="verbatim">&gt;&gt;&gt; from Bio import SeqIO

&gt;&gt;&gt; records = SeqIO.parse(file_handle, format="fasta")

</PRE><P>Now we take the sequence as a plain string from the SeqRecord:
</P><PRE CLASS="verbatim">&gt;&gt;&gt; sequence = record.seq.data
</PRE><P>and run BLAST on it. The code to do the simplest possible BLAST
(a simple blastn of the FASTA file against all of the non-redundant
databases) is:</P><PRE CLASS="verbatim">&gt;&gt;&gt; from Bio.Blast import NCBIWWW
&gt;&gt;&gt; result_handle = NCBIWWW.qblast("blastn", "nr", sequence)
</PRE><P>The <CODE>qblast</CODE> function also take a number of other option arguments
which are basically analogous to the different parameters you can set
on the basic BLAST page
(<A HREF="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/blast.cgi?Jform=0"><TT>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/blast.cgi?Jform=0</TT></A>),
but for this I&#X2019;ll just talk about the first few arguments, which are
the most important. The first three are non-optional.</P><UL CLASS="itemize"><LI CLASS="li-itemize">
The first argument is the blast program to use for the search. The

<A HREF="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/blast_program.html"><TT>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/blast_program.html</TT></A>.
Currently <CODE>qblast</CODE> only works with blastn and blastp as program
arguments &#X2014; let us known if you want to use one of the other blast
programs instead.
</LI><LI CLASS="li-itemize">The second argument specifies the databases to search against. Again,
the options for this are available on the NCBI web pages at
<A HREF="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/blast_databases.html"><TT>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/blast_databases.html</TT></A>.
</LI><LI CLASS="li-itemize">The third argument is your Fasta sequence as a plain string.
</LI><LI CLASS="li-itemize">The <CODE>qblast</CODE> function can return the BLAST results in various
formats, which you can choose with the optional <CODE>format_type</CODE> keyword:
<CODE>"HTML"</CODE>, <CODE>"Text"</CODE>, <CODE>"ASN.1"</CODE>, or <CODE>"XML"</CODE>.
The default is <CODE>"XML"</CODE>, as that is the format expected by the parser,
described in section&#XA0;<A HREF="#sec:parsing-blast">5.4</A> below.

<A NAME="sec:saving-blast-output"></A></P><P>Before parsing the results, it is often useful to save them into a
file so that you can use them later without having to go back and
re-blast everything. I find this especially useful when debugging my
code that extracts info from the BLAST files, but it could also be
useful just for making backups of things you&#X2019;ve done.</P><P>If you don&#X2019;t want to save the BLAST output, you can skip to

read the BLAST output only once &#X2013; calling <CODE>result_handle.read()</CODE> again
returns an empty string. First, we use <CODE>read()</CODE> and store all of
the information from the handle into a string:</P><PRE CLASS="verbatim">&gt;&gt;&gt; blast_results = result_handle.read()

</PRE><P>After doing this, the results are in the file <CODE>my_blast.xml</CODE> and the
variable <CODE>blast_results</CODE> contains the BLAST results in a string
form. However, the <CODE>parse</CODE> function of the BLAST parser (described
in&#XA0;<A HREF="#sec:parsing-blast">5.4</A>) takes a file-handle-like object, not a
plain string. To get a handle, there are two things you can do:
</P><UL CLASS="itemize"><LI CLASS="li-itemize">
Use the Python standard library module <CODE>cStringIO</CODE>. The

<A NAME="sec:parsing-blast"></A></P><P>As mentioned above, BLAST can generate output in various formats,
such as XML, HTML, and plain text. Originally, Biopython had a parser for
BLAST plain text and HTML output, as these were the output formats supported
by BLAST. Unfortunately, the BLAST output in these formats kept changing,
each time breaking the Biopython parsers. As keeping up with changes in BLAST
became a hopeless endeavor, especially with users running different BLAST
versions, we now recommend to parse the output in XML format, which can be
generated by recent versions of BLAST. Not only is the XML output more stable
than the plain text and HTML output, it is also much easier to parse
automatically, making Biopython a whole lot more stable.</P><P>Though deprecated, the parsers for BLAST output in plain text or HTML output
are still available in Biopython
(see Section&#XA0;<A HREF="#sec:parsing-blast-deprecated">5.6</A>).
Use them at your own risk: they may or may not work, depending on which BLAST
version you&#X2019;re using.</P><P>You can get BLAST output in XML format in various ways. For the parser, it
doesn&#X2019;t matter how the output was generated, as long as it is in the XML format.

</LI></UL><P>
The important point is that you do not have to use Biopython
scripts to fetch the data in order to be able to parse it.</P><P>Doing things in one of these ways, you then need to get a handle
to the results. In Python, a handle is just a nice general way of
describing input to any info source so that the info can be retrieved
using <CODE>read()</CODE> and <CODE>readline()</CODE> functions. This is the type
of input the BLAST parser (and the other Biopython parsers take). </P><P>If you followed the code above for interacting with BLAST through a
script, then you already have <CODE>result_handle</CODE>, the handle to the
BLAST results. If instead you ran BLAST some other way, and have the
BLAST output (in XML format) in the file <CODE>my_blast.xml</CODE>, all you
need to do is to open the file for reading:</P><PRE CLASS="verbatim">&gt;&gt;&gt; result_handle = open("my_blast.xml")
</PRE><P>Now that we&#X2019;ve got a handle, we are ready to parse the output. The
code to parse it is really quite small:</P><PRE CLASS="verbatim">&gt;&gt;&gt; from Bio.Blast import NCBIXML
&gt;&gt;&gt; blast_records = NCBIXML.parse(result_handle)
</PRE><P>To understand what <CODE>NCBIXML.parse</CODE> returns, there are two things
that you need to keep in mind:
</P><UL CLASS="itemize"><LI CLASS="li-itemize">
The BLAST output may contain the output of more than
one BLAST search. This will for example be the case if you ran BLAST locally
on a Fasta file containing more than one sequence. For each sequence, the
BLAST parser will return one BLAST record.
</LI><LI CLASS="li-itemize">The BLAST output may therefore be huge.
</LI></UL><P>To be able to handle these situations, <CODE>NCBIXML.parse</CODE> returns an
iterator (just like <CODE>Bio.SeqIO.parse</CODE>). In plain English, an iterator
allows you to step through the BLAST output, retrieving BLAST records one
by one for each BLAST search:</P><PRE CLASS="verbatim">&gt;&gt;&gt; blast_record = blast_records.next()
# ... do something with blast_record

# ... do something with blast_record
&gt;&gt;&gt; blast_record = blast_records.next()
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
StopIteration
# No further records
</PRE><P>Or, you can use a <CODE>for</CODE>-loop:
</P><PRE CLASS="verbatim">&gt;&gt;&gt; for blast_record in blast_records:
...     # Do something with blast_record
</PRE><P>Note though that you can step through the BLAST records only once.
Usually, from each BLAST record you would save the information that
you are interested in. If you want to save all returned BLAST records,
you can convert the iterator into a list:
</P><PRE CLASS="verbatim">&gt;&gt;&gt; blast_records = list(blast_records)
</PRE><P>Now you can access each BLAST record in the list with an index as usual.
If your BLAST file is huge though, you may run into problems trying to
save them all in a list.</P><P>Usually, you&#X2019;ll be running one BLAST search at a time. Then, all you need
to do is to pick up the first (and only) BLAST record in <CODE>blast_records</CODE>:

As with the XML parser, we need to have a handle object that we can pass to the parser. The handle must implement the <CODE>readline()</CODE> method and do this properly. The common ways to get such a handle are to either use the provided <CODE>blastall</CODE> or <CODE>blastpgp</CODE> functions to run the local blast, or to run a local blast via the command line, and then do something like the following:</P><PRE CLASS="verbatim">&gt;&gt;&gt; result_handle = open("my_file_of_blast_output.txt")

This is a serious problem, since you can&#X2019;t tell if the SyntaxError is due to a parser problem, or a problem with the BLAST. To make it even worse, you have no idea where the parse failed, so you can&#X2019;t just ignore the error, since this could be ignoring an important data point.</P><P>We used to have to make a little script to get around this problem, but the <CODE>Bio.Blast</CODE> module now includes a <CODE>BlastErrorParser</CODE> which really helps make this easier. The <CODE>BlastErrorParser</CODE> works very similar to the regular <CODE>BlastParser</CODE>, but it adds an extra layer of work by catching SyntaxErrors that are generated by the parser, and attempting to diagnose the errors.</P><P>Let&#X2019;s take a look at using this parser &#X2013; first we define the file we are going to parse and the file to write the problem reports to:</P><PRE CLASS="verbatim">&gt;&gt;&gt; import os

&gt;&gt;&gt; error_handle = open(error_file, "w")

&gt;&gt;&gt; blast_error_parser = NCBIStandalone.BlastErrorParser(error_handle)
</PRE><P>Notice that the parser take an optional argument of a handle. If a handle is passed, then the parser will write any blast records which generate a SyntaxError to this handle. Otherwise, these records will not be recorded.</P><P>Now we can use the <CODE>BlastErrorParser</CODE> just like a regular blast parser. Specifically, we might want to make an iterator that goes through our blast records one at a time and parses them with the error parser:</P><PRE CLASS="verbatim">&gt;&gt;&gt; result_handle = open(blast_file)
&gt;&gt;&gt; iterator = NCBIStandalone.Iterator(result_handle, blast_error_parser)

... except NCBIStandalone.LowQualityBlastError, info:
...     print "LowQualityBlastError detected in id %s" % info[1]
</PRE><P>Right now the <CODE>BlastErrorParser</CODE> can generate the following errors:</P><UL CLASS="itemize"><LI CLASS="li-itemize">
<CODE>SyntaxError</CODE> &#X2013; This is the same error generated by the regular BlastParser, and is due to the parser not being able to parse a specific file. This is normally either due to a bug in the parser, or some kind of discrepancy between the version of BLAST you are using and the versions the parser is able to handle.</LI><LI CLASS="li-itemize"><CODE>LowQualityBlastError</CODE> &#X2013; When BLASTing a sequence that is of really bad quality (for example, a short sequence that is basically a stretch of one nucleotide), it seems that Blast ends up masking out the entire sequence and ending up with nothing to parse. In this case it will produce a truncated report that causes the parser to generate a SyntaxError. <CODE>LowQualityBlastError</CODE> is reported in these cases. This error returns an info item with the following information:
<UL CLASS="itemize"><LI CLASS="li-itemize">
<CODE>item[0]</CODE> &#X2013; The error message
</LI><LI CLASS="li-itemize"><CODE>item[1]</CODE> &#X2013; The id of the input record that caused the error. This is really useful if you want to record all of the records that are causing problems.
</LI></UL>
</LI></UL><P>As mentioned, with each error generated, the BlastErrorParser will write the offending record to the specified <CODE>error_handle</CODE>. You can then go ahead and look and these and deal with them as you see fit. Either you will be able to debug the parser with a single blast report, or will find out problems in your blast runs. Either way, it will definitely be a useful experience!</P><P>Hopefully the <CODE>BlastErrorParser</CODE> will make it much easier to debug and deal with large Blast files.</P><!--TOC section Dealing with PSIBlast-->

Let&#X2019;s look at how we connect with it from a script and parse SwissProt formatted results. We touched on this briefly in Section&#XA0;<A HREF="#sec:SeqIO_ExPASy_and_SwissProt">4.1.3</A>.</P><P>First, we need to retrieve some results to parse. Let&#X2019;s say we are looking at chalcone synthases for Orchids (see section&#XA0;<A HREF="#sec:orchids">2.3</A> for some justification for looking for interesting things about orchids). Chalcone synthase is involved in flavanoid biosynthesis in plants, and flavanoids make lots of cool things like pigment colors and UV protectants. </P><P>If you do a search on SwissProt, you can find three orchid proteins for Chalcone Synthase, id numbers O23729, O23730, O23731. Now, let&#X2019;s write a script which grabs these, and parses out some interesting information.</P><P>First, we grab the records, using the <CODE>get_sprot_raw()</CODE> function of <CODE>Bio.WWW.ExPASy</CODE>. This function is very nice since you can feed it an id and get back a raw text record (no html to mess with!). As we get the three records we are interested in, we&#X2019;ll just put them together into one big string, which we&#X2019;ll then use for parsing. The following code accomplishes what I just wrote:</P><PRE CLASS="verbatim">from Bio.WWW import ExPASy

ids = ["O23729", "O23730", "O23731"]

all_results = ""
for eid in ids:
    results = ExPASy.get_sprot_raw(eid)
    all_results = all_results + results.read()
</PRE><P>Now that we&#X2019;ve got the results, we are ready to parse them into interesting information. As with most parsers, we set up an iterator and parser. The parser we use here parses the SwissProt files into a Record object where the interesting features are attributes:</P><PRE CLASS="verbatim">from Bio.SwissProt import SProt
from Bio import File

s_parser = SProt.RecordParser()
s_iterator = SProt.Iterator(File.StringHandle(all_results), s_parser)
</PRE><P>Note that we convert <CODE>all_results</CODE>, which is a string, into a handle before passing it. The iterator requires a handle to be passed so that it can read in everything one line at a time. The <CODE>Bio.File</CODE> module has a nice StringHandle, which conveniently will convert a string into a handle. Very nice!

<A NAME="genbank-retrieval"></A></P><P>One very nice feature of the GenBank libraries is the ability to automate retrieval of entries from GenBank. This is very convenient for creating scripts that automate a lot of your daily work. In this example we&#X2019;ll show how to query the NCBI databases, and to retrieve the records from the query - something touched on in Section&#XA0;<A HREF="#sec:SeqIO_GenBank_Online">4.1.2</A>.</P><P>First, we want to make a query and find out the ids of the records to retrieve. Here we&#X2019;ll do a quick search for <EM>Opuntia</EM>, my favorite organism (since I work on it). We can do quick search and get back the GIs (GenBank identifiers) for all of the corresponding records:</P><PRE CLASS="verbatim">from Bio import GenBank

</PRE><P>Now that we&#X2019;ve got the GIs, we can use these to access the NCBI database through a dictionary interface. For instance, to retrieve the information for the first GI, we&#X2019;ll first have to create a dictionary that accesses NCBI:</P><PRE CLASS="verbatim">ncbi_dict = GenBank.NCBIDictionary("nucleotide", "genbank")
</PRE><P>Now that we&#X2019;ve got this, we do the retrieval:</P><PRE CLASS="verbatim">gb_record = ncbi_dict[gi_list[0]]
</PRE><P>In this case, <CODE>gb_record</CODE> will be GenBank formatted record:</P><PRE CLASS="verbatim">LOCUS       AF191665      902 bp    DNA             PLN       07-NOV-1999

</PRE><P>In this case, we are just getting the raw records. We can also pass these records directly into a parser and return the parsed record. For instance, if we wanted to get back SeqRecord objects with the GenBank file parsed into SeqFeature objects we would need to create the dictionary with the GenBank FeatureParser:</P><PRE CLASS="verbatim">record_parser = GenBank.FeatureParser()
ncbi_dict = GenBank.NCBIDictionary("nucleotide", "genbank",
                                   parser = record_parser)

<A NAME="sec:gb-parsing"></A></P><P>While GenBank files are nice and have lots of information, at the same time you probably only want to extract a small amount of that information at a time. The key to doing this is parsing out the information. Biopython provides GenBank parsers which help you accomplish this task. Right now the GenBank module provides the following parsers:</P><OL CLASS="enumerate" type=1><LI CLASS="li-enumerate">
RecordParser &#X2013; This parses the raw record into a GenBank specific Record object. This object models the information in a raw record very closely, so this is good to use if you are just interested in GenBank records themselves.</LI><LI CLASS="li-enumerate">FeatureParser &#X2013; This parses the raw record in a SeqRecord object with all of the feature table information represented in SeqFeatures (see section&#XA0;<A HREF="#sec:advanced-seq">6.6</A> for more info on these objects). This is best to use if you are interested in getting things in a more standard format.
</LI></OL><P>Depending on the type of GenBank files you are interested in, they will either contain a single record, or multiple records. Each record will start with a <TT>LOCUS</TT> line, various other header lines, a list of features, and finally the sequence data, ending with a <TT>//</TT> line.</P><P>Dealing with a GenBank file containing a single record is very easy. For example, let&#X2019;s use a small bacterial genome, <EM>Nanoarchaeum equitans Kin4-M</EM> (RefSeq NC_005213, GenBank AE017199) which can be downloaded from the NCBI here <A HREF="ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/genomes/Bacteria/Nanoarchaeum_equitans/AE017199.gbk">(</A>only 1.15 MB):</P><PRE CLASS="verbatim">from Bio import GenBank

<H3 CLASS="subsection"><!--SEC ANCHOR --><A NAME="htoc60">6.3.4</A>&#XA0;&#XA0;Making your very own GenBank database</H3><!--SEC END --><P>One very cool thing that you can do is set up your own personal GenBank database and access it like a dictionary (this can be extra cool because you can also allow access to these local databases over a network using BioCorba &#X2013; see the BioCorba documentation for more information).</P><P>Note - this is only worth doing if your GenBank file contains more than one record.</P><P>Making a local database first involves creating an index file, which will allow quick access to any record in the file. To do this, we use the index file function.
Again, this example uses the file <CODE>cor6_6.gb</CODE> which is included in the BioPython source code under the Tests/GenBank/ directory:</P><PRE CLASS="verbatim">&gt;&gt;&gt; from Bio import GenBank

&gt;&gt;&gt; GenBank.index_file(dict_file, index_file)
</PRE><P>This will create a directory called <CODE>cor6_6.idx</CODE> containing the index files. Now, we can use this index to create a dictionary object that allows individual access to every record. Like the Iterator and NCBIDictionary interfaces, we can either get back raw records, or we can pass the dictionary a parser that will parse the records before returning them. In this case, we pass a <CODE>FeatureParser</CODE> so that when we get a record, then we retrieve a SeqRecord object. </P><P>Setting up the dictionary is as easy as one line:</P><PRE CLASS="verbatim">&gt;&gt;&gt; gb_dict = GenBank.Dictionary(index_file, GenBank.FeatureParser())

Biopython offers access to alignments in clustal format (these normally have a <CODE>*.aln</CODE> extension) that are produced by Clustalx. It also offers access to clustalw, which the is command line version of clustalx.</P><P>We&#X2019;ll need some sequences to align, such as <A HREF="examples/opuntia.fasta">opuntia.fasta</A> (also available online <A HREF="http://biopython.org/DIST/docs/tutorial/examples/opuntia.fasta">here</A>) which is a small FASTA file containing seven orchid gene DNA sequences, which you can also from <CODE>Doc/examples/</CODE> in the Biopython source distribution.</P><P>The first step in interacting with clustalw is to set up a command line you want to pass to the program. Clustalw has a ton of command line options, and if you set a lot of parameters, you can end up typing in a huge ol&#X2019; command line quite a bit. This command line class models the command line by making all of the options be attributes of the class that can be set. A few convenience functions also exist to set certain parameters, so that some error checking on the parameters can be done.</P><P>To create a command line object to do a clustalw multiple alignment we do the following:</P><PRE CLASS="verbatim">import os
from Bio.Clustalw import MultipleAlignCL

cline = MultipleAlignCL(os.path.join(os.curdir, "opuntia.fasta"))
cline.set_output("test.aln")
</PRE><P>First we import the <CODE>MultipleAlignCL</CODE> object, which models running a multiple alignment from clustalw. We then initialize the command line, with a single argument of the fasta file that we are going to be using for the alignment. The initialization function also takes an optional second argument which specifies the location of the <CODE>clustalw</CODE> executable. By default, the commandline will just be invoked with &#X2019;clustalw,&#X2019; assuming that you&#X2019;ve got it somewhere on your <CODE>PATH</CODE>.</P><P>The second argument sets the output to go to the file <CODE>test.aln</CODE>. The <CODE>MultipleAlignCL</CODE> object also has numerous other parameters to specify things like output format, gap costs, etc. </P><P>We can look at the command line we have generated by invoking the <CODE>__str__</CODE> member attribute of the <CODE>MultipleAlignCL</CODE> class. This is done by calling <CODE>str(cline)</CODE> or simple by printing out the command line with <CODE>print cline</CODE>. In this case, doing this would give the following output:</P><PRE CLASS="verbatim">clustalw ./opuntia.fasta -OUTFILE=test.aln
</PRE><P>Now that we&#X2019;ve set up a simple command line, we now want to run the commandline and collect the results so we can deal with them. This can be done using the <CODE>do_alignment</CODE> function of <CODE>Clustalw</CODE> as follows:</P><PRE CLASS="verbatim">from Bio import Clustalw

alignment = Clustalw.do_alignment(cline)
</PRE><P>What happens when you run this if that Biopython executes your command line and runs clustalw with the given parameters. It then grabs the output, and if it is in a format that Biopython can parse (currently only clustal format), then it will parse the results and return them as an alignment object of the appropriate type. So in this case since we are getting results in the default clustal format, the returned <CODE>alignment</CODE> object will be a <CODE>ClustalAlignment</CODE> type.</P><P>Once we&#X2019;ve got this alignment, we can do some interesting things with it such as get <CODE>seq_record</CODE> objects for all of the sequences involved in the alignment:</P><PRE CLASS="verbatim">all_records = alignment.get_all_seqs()

print 'description:', all_records[0].description
print 'sequence:', all_records[0].seq
</PRE><P>This prints out the description and sequence object for the first sequence in the alignment:</P><PRE CLASS="verbatim">description: gi|6273285|gb|AF191659.1|AF191
sequence: Seq('TATACATTAAAGAAGGGGGATGCGGATAAATGGAAAGGCGAAAGAAAGAAAAAAATGAAT 
...', IUPACAmbiguousDNA())
</PRE><P>You can also calculate the maximum length of the alignment with:</P><PRE CLASS="verbatim">length = alignment.get_alignment_length()
</PRE><P>Finally, to write out the alignment object in the original format, we just need to access the <CODE>__str__</CODE> function. So doing a <CODE>print alignment</CODE> gives:</P><PRE CLASS="verbatim">CLUSTAL X (1.81) multiple sequence alignment


gi|6273285|gb|AF191659.1|AF191      TATACATTAAAGAAGGGGGATGCGGATAAATGGAAAGGCGAAAGAAAGAA

...
</PRE><P>This makes it easy to write your alignment back into a file with all of the original info intact.</P><P>If you want to do more interesting things with an alignment, the best thing to do is to pass the alignment to an alignment information generating object, such as the SummaryInfo object, described in section&#XA0;<A HREF="#sec:summary_info">6.4.2</A>.</P><!--TOC subsection Calculating summary information-->

<A NAME="sec:pssm"></A></P><P>Position specific score matrices (PSSMs) summarize the alignment information in a different way than a consensus, and may be useful for different tasks. Basically, a PSSM is a count matrix. For each column in the alignment, the number of each alphabet letters is counted and totaled. The totals are displayed relative to some representative sequence along the left axis. This sequence may be the consesus sequence, but can also be any sequence in the alignment. For instance for the alignment:</P><PRE CLASS="verbatim">GTATC
AT--C
CTGTC
</PRE><P>the PSSM for this alignment is:</P><PRE CLASS="verbatim">      G A T C
    G 1 1 0 1
    T 0 0 3 0
    A 1 1 0 0
    T 0 0 2 0
    C 0 0 0 3
</PRE><P>Let&#X2019;s assume we&#X2019;ve got an alignment object called <CODE>c_align</CODE>. To get a PSSM with the consensus sequence along the side we first get a summary object and calculate the consensus sequence:</P><PRE CLASS="verbatim">summary_align = AlignInfo.SummaryInfo(c_align)
consensus = summary_align.dumb_consensus()
</PRE><P>Now, we want to make the PSSM, but ignore any <CODE>N</CODE> ambiguity residues when calculating this:</P><PRE CLASS="verbatim">my_pssm = summary_align.pos_specific_score_matrix(consensus,
                                                  chars_to_ignore = ['N'])
</PRE><P>Two notes should be made about this:</P><OL CLASS="enumerate" type=1><LI CLASS="li-enumerate">
To maintain strictness with the alphabets, you can only include characters along the top of the PSSM that are in the alphabet of the alignment object. Gaps are not included along the top axis of the PSSM.</LI><LI CLASS="li-enumerate">The sequence passed to be displayed along the left side of the axis does not need to be the consensus. For instance, if you wanted to display the second sequence in the alignment along this axis, you would need to do:<PRE CLASS="verbatim">second_seq = alignment.get_seq_by_num(1)
my_pssm = summary_align.pos_specific_score_matrix(second_seq
                                                  chars_to_ignore = ['N'])
</PRE></LI></OL><P>The command above returns a <CODE>PSSM</CODE> object. To print out the PSSM as we showed above, we simply need to do a <CODE>print my_pssm</CODE>, which gives:</P><PRE CLASS="verbatim">    A   C   G   T

T  0.0 0.0 0.0 7.0
T  1.0 0.0 0.0 6.0
...
</PRE><P>You can access any element of the PSSM by subscripting like <CODE>your_pssm[sequence_number][residue_count_name]</CODE>. For instance, to get the counts for the &#X2019;A&#X2019; residue in the second element of the above PSSM you would do:</P><PRE CLASS="verbatim">&gt;&gt;&gt; print my_pssm[1]['A']

</LI></UL><P>Well, now that we have an idea what information content is being calculated in Biopython, let&#X2019;s look at how to get it for a particular region of the alignment.</P><P>First, we need to use our alignment to get a alignment summary object, which we&#X2019;ll assume is called <CODE>summary_align</CODE> (see section&#XA0;<A HREF="#sec:summary_info">6.4.2</A>) for instructions on how to get this. Once we&#X2019;ve got this object, calculating the information content for a region is as easy as:</P><PRE CLASS="verbatim">info_content = summary_align.information_content(5, 30,

</PRE><P>Wow, that was much easier then the formula above made it look! The variable <CODE>info_content</CODE> now contains a float value specifying the information content over the specified region (from 5 to 30 of the alignment). We specifically ignore the ambiguity residue &#X2019;N&#X2019; when calculating the information content, since this value is not included in our alphabet (so we shouldn&#X2019;t be interested in looking at it!).</P><P>As mentioned above, we can also calculate relative information content by supplying the expected frequencies:</P><PRE CLASS="verbatim">expect_freq = {
    'A' : .3,
    'G' : .2,
    'T' : .3,
    'C' : .2}
</PRE><P>The expected should not be passed as a raw dictionary, but instead by passed as a <CODE>SubsMat.FreqTable</CODE> object (see section&#XA0;<A HREF="#sec:freq_table">7.4.2</A> for more information about FreqTables). The FreqTable object provides a standard for associating the dictionary with an Alphabet, similar to how the Biopython Seq class works. </P><P>To create a FreqTable object, from the frequency dictionary you just need to do:</P><PRE CLASS="verbatim">from Bio.Alphabet import IUPAC

                                   IUPAC.unambiguous_dna)
</PRE><P>Now that we&#X2019;ve got that, calculating the relative information content for our region of the alignment is as simple as:</P><PRE CLASS="verbatim">info_content = summary_align.information_content(5, 30,

</PRE><P>Now, <CODE>info_content</CODE> will contain the relative information content over the region in relation to the expected frequencies.</P><P>The value return is calculated using base 2 as the logarithm base in the formula above.

alignments. In this example, we&#X2019;ll first get a biopython alignment
object and then get a summary object to calculate info about the
alignment. The file containing <A HREF="examples/protein.aln">protein.aln</A>

to find out the number of times different residues substitute for each

acids with polar charged side chains. Luckily, this can be done easily 
when generating a replacement dictionary, by passing in all of the
characters that should be ignored. Thus we&#X2019;ll create a dictionary of
replacements for only charged polar amino acids using:</P><PRE CLASS="verbatim">replace_info = summary_align.replacement_dictionary(["G", "A", "V", "L", "I",

</PRE><P>This information gives us our accepted number of replacements, or how
often we expect different things to substitute for each other. It
turns out, amazingly enough, that this is all of the information we
need to go ahead and create a substitution matrix. First, we use the
replacement dictionary information to create an Accepted Replacement
Matrix (ARM):</P><PRE CLASS="verbatim">from Bio import SubsMat

For example, a common key for a qualifier might be &#X201C;evidence&#X201D; and the value might be &#X201C;computational (non-experimental).&#X201D; This is just a way to let the person who is looking at the feature know that it has not be experimentally (i.&#XA0;e.&#XA0;in a wet lab) confirmed.</DD><DT CLASS="dt-description"><B>sub_features</B></DT><DD CLASS="dd-description"> &#X2013; A very important feature of a feature is that it can have additional <CODE>sub_features</CODE> underneath it. This allows nesting of features, and helps us to deal with things such as the GenBank/EMBL feature lines in a (we hope) intuitive way.
</DD></DL><P>To show an example of SeqFeatures in action, let&#X2019;s take a look at the following feature from a GenBank feature table:</P><PRE CLASS="verbatim">     mRNA            complement(join(&lt;49223..49300,49780..&gt;50208))
                     /gene="F28B23.12"
</PRE><P>To look at the easiest attributes of the SeqFeature first, if you got a SeqFeature object for this it would have it <CODE>type</CODE> of &#X2019;mRNA&#X2019;, a <CODE>strand</CODE> of -1 (due to the &#X2019;complement&#X2019;), and would have None for the <CODE>ref</CODE> and <CODE>ref_db</CODE> since there are no references to external databases. The <CODE>qualifiers</CODE> for this SeqFeature would be a python dictionarary that looked like <CODE>{'gene' : 'F28B23.12'}</CODE>.</P><P>Now let&#X2019;s look at the more tricky part, how the &#X2019;join&#X2019; in the location 
line is handled. First, the location for the top level SeqFeature (the 
one we are dealing with right now) is set as going from 
<CODE>'&lt;49223' to '&gt;50208'</CODE> (see section&#XA0;<A HREF="#sec:locations">6.6.2.2</A> for 
the nitty gritty on how fuzzy locations like this are handled). 
So the location of the top level object is the entire span of the 
feature. So, how do you get at the information in the &#X2019;join?&#X2019; 
Well, that&#X2019;s where the <CODE>sub_features</CODE> go in.</P><P>The <CODE>sub_features</CODE> attribute will have a list with two SeqFeature 
objects in it, and these contain the information in the join. Let&#X2019;s 
look at <CODE>top_level_feature.sub_features[0]</CODE>; the first 
<CODE>sub_feature</CODE>). This object is a SeqFeature object with a 
<CODE>type</CODE> of &#X2019;<CODE>mRNA_join</CODE>,&#X2019; a <CODE>strand</CODE> of -1 (inherited 
from the parent SeqFeature) and a location going from 
<CODE>'&lt;49223' to '49300'</CODE>. </P><P>So, the <CODE>sub_features</CODE> allow you to get at the internal information if you want it (i.&#XA0;e.&#XA0;if you were trying to get only the exons out of a genomic sequence), or just to deal with the broad picture (i.&#XA0;e.&#XA0;you just want to know that the coding sequence for a gene lies in a region). Hopefully this structuring makes it easy and intuitive to get at the sometimes complex information that can be contained in a SeqFeature.</P><!--TOC subsubsection Locations-->
<H4 CLASS="subsubsection"><!--SEC ANCHOR -->6.6.2.2&#XA0;&#XA0;Locations</H4><!--SEC END --><P>
<A NAME="sec:locations"></A></P><P>In the section on SeqFeatures above, we skipped over one of the more difficult parts of Features, dealing with the locations. The reason this can be difficult is because of fuzziness of the positions in locations. Before we get into all of this, let&#X2019;s just define the vocabulary we&#X2019;ll use to talk about this. Basically there are two terms we&#X2019;ll use:</P><DL CLASS="description"><DT CLASS="dt-description">
<B>position</B></DT><DD CLASS="dd-description"> &#X2013; This refers to a single position on a sequence, 
which may be fuzzy or not. For instance, 5, 20, <CODE>&lt;100</CODE> and 
<CODE>3^5</CODE> are all positions.</DD><DT CLASS="dt-description"><B>location</B></DT><DD CLASS="dd-description"> &#X2013; A location is two positions that defines a region of a sequence. For instance 5..20 (i.&#XA0;e.&#XA0;5 to 20) is a location.
</DD></DL><P>I just mention this because sometimes I get confused between the two.</P><P>The complication in dealing with locations comes in the positions themselves. In biology many times things aren&#X2019;t entirely certain (as much as us wet lab biologists try to make them certain!). For instance, you might do a dinucleotide priming experiment and discover that the start of mRNA transcript starts at one of two sites. This is very useful information, but the complication comes in how to represent this as a position. To help us deal with this, we have the concept of fuzzy positions. Basically there are five types of fuzzy positions, so we have five classes do deal with them:</P><DL CLASS="description"><DT CLASS="dt-description">
<B>ExactPosition</B></DT><DD CLASS="dd-description"> &#X2013; As its name suggests, this class represents a position which is specified as exact along the sequence. This is represented as just a a number, and you can get the position by looking at the <CODE>position</CODE> attribute of the object.</DD><DT CLASS="dt-description"><B>BeforePosition</B></DT><DD CLASS="dd-description"> &#X2013; This class represents a fuzzy position 
that occurs prior to some specified site. In GenBank/EMBL notation, 
this is represented as something like <CODE>'&lt;13'</CODE>, signifying that 
the real position is located somewhere less then 13. To get 
the specified upper boundary, look at the <CODE>position</CODE> 
attribute of the object.</DD><DT CLASS="dt-description"><B>AfterPosition</B></DT><DD CLASS="dd-description"> &#X2013; Contrary to <CODE>BeforePosition</CODE>, this 
class represents a position that occurs after some specified site. 
This is represented in GenBank as <CODE>'&gt;13'</CODE>, and like 
<CODE>BeforePosition</CODE>, you get the boundary number by looking 
at the <CODE>position</CODE> attribute of the object.</DD><DT CLASS="dt-description"><B>WithinPosition</B></DT><DD CLASS="dd-description"> &#X2013; This class models a position which occurs somewhere between two specified nucleotides. In GenBank/EMBL notation, this would be represented as &#X2019;(1.5)&#X2019;, to represent that the position is somewhere within the range 1 to 5. To get the information in this class you have to look at two attributes. The <CODE>position</CODE> attribute specifies the lower boundary of the range we are looking at, so in our example case this would be one. The <CODE>extension</CODE> attribute specifies the range to the higher boundary, so in this case it would be 4. So <CODE>object.position</CODE> is the lower boundary and <CODE>object.position + object.extension</CODE> is the upper boundary.</DD><DT CLASS="dt-description"><B>BetweenPosition</B></DT><DD CLASS="dd-description"> &#X2013; This class deals with a position that 
occurs between two coordinates. For instance, you might have a 
protein binding site that occurs between two nucleotides on a 
sequence. This is represented as <CODE>'2^3'</CODE>, which indicates that 
the real position happens between position 2 and 3. Getting 
this information from the object is very similar to 
<CODE>WithinPosition</CODE>, the <CODE>position</CODE> attribute specifies 
the lower boundary (2, in this case) and the <CODE>extension</CODE> 
indicates the range to the higher boundary (1 in this case).
</DD></DL><P>Now that we&#X2019;ve got all of the types of fuzzy positions we can have taken care of, we are ready to actually specify a location on a sequence. This is handled by the <CODE>FeatureLocation</CODE> class. An object of this type basically just holds the potentially fuzzy start and end positions of a feature. You can create a <CODE>FeatureLocation</CODE> object by creating the positions and passing them in:</P><PRE CLASS="verbatim">&gt;&gt;&gt; from Bio import SeqFeature
&gt;&gt;&gt; start_pos = SeqFeature.AfterPosition(5)
&gt;&gt;&gt; end_pos = SeqFeature.BetweenPosition(8, 1)
&gt;&gt;&gt; my_location = SeqFeature.FeatureLocation(start_pos, end_pos)
</PRE><P>If you print out a <CODE>FeatureLocation</CODE> object, you can get a nice representation of the information:</P><PRE CLASS="verbatim">&gt;&gt;&gt; print my_location
[&gt;5:(8^9)]
</PRE><P>We can access the fuzzy start and end positions using the start and end attributes of the location:</P><PRE CLASS="verbatim">&gt;&gt;&gt; my_location.start
&lt;Bio.SeqFeature.AfterPosition instance at 0x101d7164&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; print my_location.start
&gt;5
&gt;&gt;&gt; print my_location.end
(8^9)
</PRE><P>If you don&#X2019;t want to deal with fuzzy positions and just want numbers, you just need to ask for the <CODE>nofuzzy_start</CODE> and <CODE>nofuzzy_end</CODE> attributes of the location:</P><PRE CLASS="verbatim">&gt;&gt;&gt; my_location.nofuzzy_start 
5
&gt;&gt;&gt; my_location.nofuzzy_end
8
</PRE><P>Notice that this just gives you back the position attributes of the fuzzy locations.</P><P>Similary, to make it easy to create a position without worrying about fuzzy positions, you can just pass in numbers to the <CODE>FeaturePosition</CODE> constructors, and you&#X2019;ll get back out <CODE>ExactPosition</CODE> objects:</P><PRE CLASS="verbatim">&gt;&gt;&gt; exact_location = SeqFeature.FeatureLocation(5, 8)
&gt;&gt;&gt; print exact_location
[5:8]
&gt;&gt;&gt; exact_location.start
&lt;Bio.SeqFeature.ExactPosition instance at 0x101dcab4&gt;
</PRE><P>That is all of the nitty gritty about dealing with fuzzy positions in Biopython. It has been designed so that dealing with fuzziness is not that much more complicated than dealing with exact positions, and hopefully you find that true!</P><!--TOC subsubsection References-->
<H4 CLASS="subsubsection"><!--SEC ANCHOR -->6.6.2.3&#XA0;&#XA0;References</H4><!--SEC END --><P>Another common annotation related to a sequence is a reference to a journal or other published work dealing with the sequence. We have a fairly simple way of representing a Reference in Biopython &#X2013; we have a <CODE>Bio.SeqFeature.Reference</CODE> class that stores the relevant information about a reference as attributes of an object.</P><P>The attributes include things that you would expect to see in a reference like <CODE>journal</CODE>, <CODE>title</CODE> and <CODE>authors</CODE>. Additionally, it also can hold the <CODE>medline_id</CODE> and <CODE>pubmed_id</CODE> and a <CODE>comment</CODE> about the reference. These are all accessed simply as attributes of the object.</P><P>A reference also has a <CODE>location</CODE> object so that it can specify a particular location on the sequence that the reference refers to. For instance, you might have a journal that is dealing with a particular gene located on a BAC, and want to specify that it only refers to this position exactly. The <CODE>location</CODE> is a potentially fuzzy location, as described in section&#XA0;<A HREF="#sec:locations">6.6.2.2</A>.</P><P>That&#X2019;s all there is too it.

<H2 CLASS="section"><!--SEC ANCHOR --><A NAME="htoc74">6.7</A>&#XA0;&#XA0;BioRegistry &#X2013; automatically finding sequence sources</H2><!--SEC END --><P>A consistently annoying problem in bioinformatics is easily finding a
sequence and making it available to your program. Sequences are
available from a ton of standard locations like NCBI and EMBL. as well
as from non-standard locations such as local databases or web servers.
To make this problem easier, Biopython (as well as the other open-bio
projects) is working towards a standard mechanism to allow specification
of the locations of resources. Once locations are specified, your code
using Biopython can readily retrieve sequences without having to worry
about the specifics of where the sequence came from.</P><P>This transparency of retrieval has a number of advantages for your code.
If a single web service is down (ie. NCBI is too busy
and is refusing connections), backup locations can be tried without
having any effect on the code that you wrote. Similary, you can have
local repositories of sequences that you use often, and then if these
repositories are off-line, switch to a web based service. Third, it
keeps the details of retrieval out of your code, allowing you to focus
on your biological problem, instead of focusing on boring retrieval
details. Finally, it&#X2019;s just a very cool idea.</P><P>This section deals with the specifics of setting up and using this
system of automatically retrieving sequences. The first section deals
with the interoperable configuration file method, while the second talks
about a similar Biopython-specific method. The configuration file method
is definately the way to go, unless you have specific needs it won&#X2019;t
give you.</P><!--TOC subsection Finding resources using a configuration file-->

<H4 CLASS="subsubsection"><!--SEC ANCHOR -->6.7.2.1&#XA0;&#XA0;Retrieving sequences</H4><!--SEC END --><P>By default, Biopython is configured to allow retrieval of sequences from
a number of standard locations. This makes it useable immediately
without knowing much about the system itself. To retrieve a Registry of
databases, all you need to do is:</P><PRE CLASS="verbatim">&gt;&gt;&gt; from Bio import db
</PRE><P>You can readily view all of the different databases that retrieval is
possible be either printing the object and examining them, or
programmatically through the keys() function of object:</P><PRE CLASS="verbatim">&gt;&gt;&gt; print db

'nucleotide-dbfetch-cgi', 'swissprot', 'pdb-rcsb-cgi']
</PRE><P>Now, let&#X2019;s say we want to retrieve a swissprot record for one of our
orchid chalcone synthases. First, we get the swissprot connection, then
we retrieve an record of interest:</P><PRE CLASS="verbatim">&gt;&gt;&gt; sp = db["swissprot"]
&gt;&gt;&gt; sp

DT   15-JUL-1999 (Rel. 38, Last annotation update)
</PRE><P>This retrieval method is nice for a number of reasons. First, we didn&#X2019;t
have to worry about where exactly swissprot records were being retrieved
from &#X2013; we only ask for an object that will give us any swissprot record
we can get. Secondly, once we get the swissprot object, we don&#X2019;t need to
worry about how we are getting our sequence &#X2013; we just ask for it by id
and don&#X2019;t worry about the implementation details.</P><P>The default biopython database registry object can be used similarly to
retrieve sequences from EMBL, prosite, PDB, interpro, GenBank and XEMBL.</P><!--TOC subsubsection Registering and Grouping databases-->
<H4 CLASS="subsubsection"><!--SEC ANCHOR -->6.7.2.2&#XA0;&#XA0;Registering and Grouping databases</H4><!--SEC END --><P>The basic registry objects are nice in that they provide basic
functionality, but if you have a more advanced system it is nice to be
able to specify new databases. This is a more advanced topic, but is
very possible with the current system. </P><P>This example describes adding a local CGI script serving out GenBank
(ie. if you had something like a local mirror of GenBank), and then
registering this and the normal NCBI GenBank as a single group to
retrieve from. This would allow you to normally get things from a local
mirror and then switch over to the main GenBank server if your server
goes down, all without adjusting your retrieval code.</P><P>First, we need to describe the CGI script to retrieve from. This example
uses a CGI script, but we eventually hope to handle other sources such
as Applications, databases, or CORBA servers (XXX, should have an
example once this is in place). We describe the CGI script as follows:</P><PRE CLASS="verbatim">from Bio.sources import CGI
local_cgi = CGI(name = "local_cgi",
                delay = 0.0,
                cgi = "http://www.myserver.org/cgi-bin/my_local.cgi",
                url = "http://www.myserver.org/cgi_documentation.html",
                doc = "Query a local databases",
                failure_cases = [])
</PRE><P>Now that we have specified the details for connecting to the CGI script,
we are ready to register this CGI script. We just need one more detail
&#X2013; specifying what the script returns upon failure to find a sequence.
We do this using Martel regular expressions:</P><PRE CLASS="verbatim">import Martel
my_failures = [
     (Martel.Str("Sequence not available"), "No sequence found")]
</PRE><P>Now we&#X2019;ve got everything we need, and can register the database:</P><PRE CLASS="verbatim">from Bio import register_db

            key = "uid",
            source = local_cgi,
            failure = my_failures)
</PRE><P>This makes the database available as before, so if we print the keys of
the database, we&#X2019;ll see "nucleotide-genbank-local" available. Now that
we&#X2019;ve got it registered, we&#X2019;d like to link all of the genbank databases
together. We do this, using a <CODE>group_db</CODE> command. First, we need to
create a group named "genbank" to retrieve things from the database:</P><PRE CLASS="verbatim">register_db(name = "genbank", behavior = "concurrent")
</PRE><P>The <CODE>behavior</CODE> argument specifies how the group will try to
retrieve things from the various databases registered with it.
<CODE>concurrent</CODE> tells it to try to retrieve from all databases at
once, and then just take whatever sequence record comes back first. You
can also specify <CODE>serial</CODE> behavior, in which the retriever will
connect to one database at a time until something gets retrieved.</P><P>Now that we&#X2019;ve got the group, we want to register our local GenBank and
the NCBI GenBank with this command:</P><PRE CLASS="verbatim">group_db("genbank", "nucleotide-genbank-local")
group_db("genbank", "nucleotide-genbank-cgi")
</PRE><P>Now we&#X2019;ve got our database access set up, and the database registry
contains our genbank and nucleotide-genbank-local entries:</P><PRE CLASS="verbatim">['embl-dbfetch-cgi', 'embl-fast', 'embl', 'prosite-expasy-cgi',

'prodoc-expasy-cgi', 'nucleotide-dbfetch-cgi', 'swissprot',

residue, atom (or SMCRA) hierarchy. Fig. <A HREF="#fig:smcra">6.10.1</A> shows a UML
class diagram of the SMCRA data structure. Such a data structure is not
necessarily best suited for the representation of the macromolecular content of
a structure, but it is absolutely necessary for a good interpretation of the
data present in a file that describes the structure (typically a PDB or MMCIF
file). If this hierarchy cannot represent the contents of a structure file, it
is fairly certain that the file contains an error or at least does not describe
the structure unambiguously. If a SMCRA data structure cannot be generated,
there is reason to suspect a problem. Parsing a PDB file can thus be used to
detect likely problems. We will give several examples of this in section
<A HREF="#problem structures">6.10.5.1</A>. </P><P>

The Atom class only (partly) implements the Entity interface (because an Atom
does not have children). </P><P>For each Entity subclass, you can extract a child by using a unique id for that
child as a key (e.g. you can extract an Atom object from a Residue object by
using an atom name string as a key, you can extract a Chain object from a Model
object by using its chain identifier as a key). </P><P>Disordered atoms and residues are represented by DisorderedAtom and DisorderedResidue
classes, which are both subclasses of the DisorderedEntityWrapper base class.
They hide the complexity associated with disorder and behave exactly as Atom
and Residue objects. </P><P>In general, a child Entity object (i.e. Atom, Residue, Chain, Model) can be
extracted from its parent (i.e. Residue, Chain, Model, Structure, respectively)
by using an id as a key.</P><PRE CLASS="verbatim">child_entity=parent_entity[child_id]

it also contains a string that specifies the residue name (e.g. &#X201C;ASN&#X201D;)
and the segment identifier of the residue (well known to X-PLOR users, but not
used in the construction of the SMCRA data structure). </P><P>The id of a Residue object is composed of three parts: the hetero field (hetfield),
the sequence identifier (resseq) and the insertion code (icode). </P><P>The hetero field is a string : it is &#X201C;W&#X201D; for waters, &#X201C;H_&#X201D; followed
by the residue name (e.g. &#X201C;H_FUC&#X201D;) for other hetero residues and blank
for standard amino and nucleic acids. This scheme is adopted for reasons described
in section <A HREF="#hetero probems">6.10.3.1</A>.</P><P>The second field in the Residue id is the sequence identifier, an integer describing
the position of the residue in the chain.</P><P>The third field is a string, consisting of the insertion code. The insertion
code is sometimes used to preserve a certain desirable residue numbering scheme.
A Ser 80 insertion mutant (inserted e.g. between a Thr 80 and an Asn 81 residue)
could e.g. have sequence identifiers and insertion codes as followed: Thr 80
A, Ser 80 B, Asn 81. In this way the residue numbering scheme stays in tune
with that of the wild type structure. </P><P>Let&#X2019;s give some examples. Asn 10 with a blank insertion code would have residue
id <TT>(&#X2019;&#X2019; &#X2019;&#X2019;, 10, &#X2019;&#X2019; &#X2019;&#X2019;)</TT>. Water 10 would have residue id <TT>(&#X2018;&#X2018;W&#X2018;&#X2018;, 10, &#X2018;&#X2018; &#X2018;&#X2018;)</TT>.
A glucose molecule (a hetero residue with residue name GLC) with sequence identifier
10 would have residue id <TT>(&#X2019;&#X2019;H_GLC&#X2019;&#X2019;, 10, &#X2019;&#X2019; &#X2019;&#X2019;)</TT>. In this way, the three
residues (with the same insertion code and sequence identifier) can be part
of the same chain because their residue id&#X2019;s are distinct.</P><P>In most cases, the hetflag and insertion code fields will be blank, e.g. <TT>(&#X2019;&#X2019; &#X2019;&#X2019;, 10, &#X2019;&#X2019; &#X2019;&#X2019;)</TT>.

the dots represent spaces). To generate an atom name (and thus an atom id) the
spaces are removed, unless this would result in a name collision in a Residue

the atom name including spaces is tried. This situation can e.g. happen when

arises from disorder. If you just want to loop over all C &#X3B1;  atoms,
you do not care that some residues have a disordered side chain. On the other
hand it should also be possible to represent disorder completely in the data
structure. Therefore, disordered atoms or residues are stored in special objects
that behave as if there is no disorder. This is done by only representing a
subset of the disordered atoms or residues. Which subset is picked (e.g. which
of the two disordered OG side chain atom positions of a Ser residue is used)
can be specified by the user.</P><!--TOC subsubsection Disordered atoms-->

Each Atom object in a DisorderedAtom object can be uniquely indexed using its
altloc specifier. The DisorderedAtom object forwards all uncaught method calls
to the selected Atom object, by default the one that represents the atom with
with the highest occupancy. The user can of course change the selected Atom

correctly without much additional complexity. In other words, if you are not

This is evidently solved by using DisorderedAtom objects to represent the disordered
atoms, and storing the DisorderedAtom object in a Residue object just like ordinary
Atom objects. The DisorderedAtom will behave exactly like an ordinary atom (in
fact the atom with the highest occupancy) by forwarding all uncaught method
calls to one of the Atom objects (the selected Atom object) it contains. </P><!--TOC paragraph Point mutations-->

of this can be found in PDB structure 1EN2. </P><P>Since these residues belong to a different residue type (e.g. let&#X2019;s say Ser
60 and Cys 60) they should not be stored in a single Residue object as in the
common case. In this case, each residue is represented by one Residue object,
and both Residue objects are stored in a DisorderedResidue object. </P><P>The DisorderedResidue object forwards all uncaught methods to the selected Residue
object (by default the last Residue object added), and thus behaves like an
ordinary residue. Each Residue object in a DisorderedResidue object can be uniquely
identified by its residue name. In the above example, residue Ser 60 would have
id &#X201C;SER&#X201D; in the DisorderedResidue object, while residue Cys 60 would
have id &#X201C;CYS&#X201D;. The user can select the active Residue object in a DisorderedResidue

<H4 CLASS="subsubsection"><!--SEC ANCHOR -->6.11.2.1&#XA0;&#XA0;FDist: Detecting selection and molecular adaptation</H4><!--SEC END --><P>FDist is a selection detection application suite based on computing
(i.e. simulating) a &#X201C;neutral&#X201D; confidence interval based on <I>F</I><SUB><I>st</I></SUB> and
heterozygosity. Markers (which can be SNPs, microsatellites, AFLPs
among others) which lie outside the &#X201C;neutral&#X201D; interval are to be
considered as possible candidates for being under selection.</P><P>FDist is mainly used when the number of markers is considered enough
to estimate an average <I>F</I><SUB><I>st</I></SUB>, but not enough to either have outliers
calculated from the dataset directly or, with even more markers for
which the relative positions in the genome are known, to use
approaches based on, e.g., Extended Haplotype Heterozygosity (EHH).</P><P>The typical usage pattern for FDist is as follows:</P><OL CLASS="enumerate" type=1><LI CLASS="li-enumerate">
Import a dataset from an external format into FDist format.
</LI><LI CLASS="li-enumerate">Compute average <I>F</I><SUB><I>st</I></SUB>. This is done by datacal inside FDist.
</LI><LI CLASS="li-enumerate">Simulate &#X201C;neutral&#X201D; markers based on the
average <I>F</I><SUB><I>st</I></SUB> and expected number of total populations.
This is the core operation, done by fdist inside FDist.
</LI><LI CLASS="li-enumerate">Calculate the confidence interval, based on the desired
confidence boundaries (typically 95% or 99%). This is done by
cplot and is mainly used to plot the interval.
</LI><LI CLASS="li-enumerate">Assess each marker status against the simulation &#X201C;neutral&#X201D;
confidence interval. Done
by pv. This is used to detect the outlier status of each marker
against the simulation.
</LI></OL><P>We will now discuss each step with illustrating example code
(for this example to work FDist binaries have to be on the
executable PATH).</P><P>The FDist data format is application specific and is not used at
all by other applications, as such you will probably have to convert
your data for use with FDist. Biopython can help you do this.
Here is an example converting from GenePop format to FDist format
(along with imports that will be needed on examples further below):</P><PRE CLASS="verbatim">from Bio.PopGen import GenePop
from Bio.PopGen import FDist
from Bio.PopGen.FDist import Controller

gp_rec = GenePop.parse(open("example.gen"))
fd_rec = convert_genepop_to_fdist(gp_rec)
in_file = open("infile", "w")
in_file.write(str(fd_rec))
in_file.close()
</PRE><P>In this code we simply parse a GenePop file and convert it to a FDist
record.</P><P>Printing an FDist record will generate
a string that can be directly saved to a file and supplied to FDist. FDist
requires the input file to be called infile, therefore we save the record on
a file with that name.</P><P>The most important fields on a FDist record are: num_pops, the number of
populations; num_loci, the number of loci and loci_data with the marker
data itself. Most probably the details of the record are of no interest
to the user, as the record only purpose is to be passed to FDist.</P><P>The next step is to calculate the average <I>F</I><SUB><I>st</I></SUB> of the dataset (along
with the sample size):</P><PRE CLASS="verbatim">ctrl = Controller.FDistController()
fst, samp_size = ctrl.run_datacal()
</PRE><P>On the first line we create an object to control the call of FDist
suite, this object will be used further on in order to call other
suite applications.</P><P>On the second line we call the datacal application which computes the
average <I>F</I><SUB><I>st</I></SUB>
and the sample size. It is worth noting that the <I>F</I><SUB><I>st</I></SUB> computed by
datacal is a <EM>variation</EM> of Weir and Cockerham&#X2019;s &#X3B8;.</P><P>We can now call the main fdist application in order to simulate neutral
markers.</P><PRE CLASS="verbatim">sim_fst = ctrl.run_fdist(npops = 15, nsamples = fd_rec.num_pops, fst = fst,

40000 will be OK, but if you get a confidence interval that looks sharp
(this can be detected when plotting the confidence interval computed
below) the value can be increased (a suggestion would be steps of 10000
simulations).
</LI></UL><P>The confusion in wording between number of samples and sample size
stems from the original application.</P><P>A file named out.dat will be created with the simulated heterozygosities
and <I>F</I><SUB><I>st</I></SUB>s, it will have as many lines as the number of simulations
requested.</P><P>Note that fdist returns the average <I>F</I><SUB><I>st</I></SUB> that it was <EM>capable</EM> of
simulating, for more details about this issue please read below the paragraph
on approximating the desired average <I>F</I><SUB><I>st</I></SUB>.</P><P>The next (optional) step is to calculate the confidence interval:</P><PRE CLASS="verbatim">cpl_interval = ctrl.run_cplot(ci=0.99)
</PRE><P>You can only call cplot after having run fdist.</P><P>This will calculate the confidence intervals (99% in this case)
for a previous fdist run. A list of quadruples is returned. The
first element represents the heterozygosity, the second the lower
bound of <I>F</I><SUB><I>st</I></SUB> confidence interval for that heterozygosity,
the third the average and the fourth the upper bound. This can
be used to trace the confidence interval contour. This list
is also written to a file, out.cpl.</P><P>The main purpose of this step is return a set of points which can
be easily used to plot a confidence interval. It can be skipped
if the objective is only to assess the status of each marker against
the simulation, which is the next step...</P><PRE CLASS="verbatim">pv_data = ctrl.run_pv()
</PRE><P>You can only call cplot after having run datacal and fdist.</P><P>This will use the simulated markers to assess the status of each
individual real marker. A list, in the same order than the loci_list
that is on the FDist record (which is in the same order that the GenePop
record) is returned. Each element in the list is a quadruple, the
fundamental member of each quadruple is the last element (regarding the
other elements, please refer to the pv documentation &#X2013; for the
sake of simplicity we will not discuss them here) which returns the
probability of the simulated <I>F</I><SUB><I>st</I></SUB> being lower than the marker <I>F</I><SUB><I>st</I></SUB>.
Higher values would indicate a stronger candidate for positive selection,
lower values a candidate for balancing selection, and intermediate values
a possible neutral marker. What is &#X201C;higher&#X201D;, &#X201C;lower&#X201D; or &#X201C;intermediate&#X201D;
is really a subjective issue, but taking a &#X201C;confidence interval&#X201D; approach
and considering a 95% confidence interval, &#X201C;higher&#X201D; would be between 0.95
and 1.0, &#X201C;lower&#X201D; between 0.0 and 0.05 and &#X201C;intermediate&#X201D; between 0.05 and

encounters a line containing the name.</P><P>Consumers are objects that receive the events generated by Scanners.

<A NAME="sec:maintain_dist"></A></P><P>We try to release Biopython to make it as easy to install as possible for users. Thus, we try to provide the Biopython libraries in as many install formats as we can. Doing this from release to release can be a lot of work for developers, and sometimes requires them to maintain packages they are not all that familiar with. This section is meant to provide tips to encourage other people besides developers to maintain platform builds.</P><P>In general, this is fairly easy &#X2013; all you would need to do is produce the system specific package whenever we make a release. You should then check the package (of course!) to make sure it installs everything properly. Then you just send it to one of the main developers, they stick the package on the web site and just like that, you&#X2019;ve contributed to Biopython! Snazzy.</P><P>Below are some tips for certain platforms to maybe get people started with helping out:</P><DL CLASS="description"><DT CLASS="dt-description">
<B>RPMs</B></DT><DD CLASS="dd-description"> &#X2013; RPMs are pretty popular package systems on some platforms. There is lots of documentation on RPMs available at <A HREF="http://www.rpm.org"><TT>http://www.rpm.org</TT></A> to help you get started with them. To create an RPM for your platform is really easy. You just need to be able to build the package from source (having a C compiler that works is thus essential) &#X2013; see the Biopython installation instructions for more info on this.<P>To make the RPM, you just need to do:</P><PRE CLASS="verbatim">python setup.py bdist_rpm
</PRE><P>This will create an RPM for your specific platform and a source RPM in the directory <CODE>dist</CODE>. This RPM should be good and ready to go, so this is all you need to do! Nice and easy.</P></DD><DT CLASS="dt-description"><B>Windows</B></DT><DD CLASS="dd-description"> &#X2013; Windows products typically have a nice graphical installer that installs all of the essential components in the right place. We can use Disttutils to create a installer of this type fairly easily.<P>You must first make sure you have a C compiler on your Windows computer, and that you can compile and install things (see the Biopython installation instructions for info on how to do this).</P><P>Once you are setup with a C compiler, making the installer just requires doing:</P><PRE CLASS="verbatim">python setup.py bdist_wininst
</PRE><P>Now you&#X2019;ve got a Windows installer. Congrats!</P></DD><DT CLASS="dt-description"><B>Macintosh</B></DT><DD CLASS="dd-description"> &#X2013; We would love to find someone who wants to maintain a Macintosh distribution, and make it available in a Macintosh friendly format like bin-hex. This would basically include finding a way to compile everything on the Mac, making sure all of the code written by us UNIX-based developers works well on the Mac, and providing any Mac-friendly hints for us.</DD></DL><P>Once you&#X2019;ve got a package, please test it on your system to make sure it installs everything in a good way and seems to work properly. Once you feel good about it, send it off to one of the biopython developers (write to our main list serve at biopython@biopython.org if you&#X2019;re not sure who to send it to) and you&#X2019;ve done it.

way, it won&#X2019;t get buried in anyone&#X2019;s Inbox and forgotten about.</P><!--TOC section Contributing Code-->
<H2 CLASS="section"><!--SEC ANCHOR --><A NAME="htoc118">8.3</A>&#XA0;&#XA0;Contributing Code</H2><!--SEC END --><P>There are no barriers to joining biopython code development other than an interest in creating biology-related code in python. The best place to express an interest is on the biopython mailing lists &#X2013; just let us know you are interested in coding and what kind of stuff you want to work on. Normally, we try to have some discussion on modules before coding them, since that helps generate good ideas &#X2013; then just feel free to jump right in and start coding!</P><P>The main biopython release tries to be fairly uniform and interworkable,
to make it easier for users. You can read about some of (fairly
informal) coding style guidelines we try to use in biopython in the
contributing documentation at 
<A HREF="http://biopython.org/wiki/Contributing"><TT>http://biopython.org/wiki/Contributing</TT></A>. We also try to add code to the distribution along with tests (see section&#XA0;<A HREF="#sec:regr_test">7.2</A> for more info on the regression testing framework) and documentation, so that everything can stay as workable and well documented as possible. This is, of course, the most ideal situation, under many situations you&#X2019;ll be able to find other people on the list who will be willing to help add documentation or more tests for your code once you make it available. So, to end this paragraph like the last, feel free to start working!</P><P>Additionally, if you have code that you don&#X2019;t think fits in the
distribution, but that you want to make available, we maintain Script
Central (<A HREF="http://biopython.org/wiki/Scriptcentral"><TT>http://biopython.org/wiki/Scriptcentral</TT></A>) 
which has pointers to freely available code in python for bioinformatics.</P><P>Hopefully this documentation has got you excited enough about
biopython to try it out (and most importantly, contribute!). Thanks

<A NAME="sec:appendix"></A></P><P>If you haven&#X2019;t spent a lot of time programming in python, many
questions and problems that come up in using Biopython are often
related to python itself. This section tries to present some ideas and 
code that come up often (at least for us!) while using the Biopython
libraries. If you have any suggestions for useful pointers that could
go here, please contribute!</P><!--TOC section What the heck is a handle?-->
<H2 CLASS="section"><!--SEC ANCHOR --><A NAME="htoc120">9.1</A>&#XA0;&#XA0;What the heck is a handle?</H2><!--SEC END --><P>
<A NAME="sec:appendix-handles"></A></P><P>Handles are mentioned quite frequently throughout this documentation,
and are also fairly confusing (at least to me!). Basically, you can
think of a handle as being a &#X201C;wrapper&#X201D; around text information.</P><P>Handles provide (at least) two benefits over plain text information:</P><OL CLASS="enumerate" type=1><LI CLASS="li-enumerate">
They provide a standard way to deal with information stored in 
different ways. The text information can be in a file, or in a
string stored in memory, or the output from a command line program,
or at some remote website, but the handle provides a common way of
dealing with information in all of these formats. </LI><LI CLASS="li-enumerate">They allow text information to be read incrementally, instead
of all at once. This is really important when you are dealing with
huge text files which would use up all of your memory if you had to
load them all.
</LI></OL><P>Handles can deal with text information that is being read (e.&#XA0;g.&#XA0;reading 
from a file) or written (e.&#XA0;g.&#XA0;writing information to a file). In the
case of a &#X201C;read&#X201D; handle, commonly used functions are <CODE>read()</CODE>,
which reads the entire text information from the handle, and
<CODE>readline()</CODE>, which reads information one line at a time. For
&#X201C;write&#X201D; handles, the function <CODE>write()</CODE> is regularly used.</P><P>The most common usage for handles is reading information from a file,
which is done using the built-in python function <CODE>open</CODE>. Here, we open a
handle to the file <A HREF="examples/m_cold.fasta">m_cold.fasta</A>
(also available online
<A HREF="http://biopython.org/DIST/docs/tutorial/examples/m_cold.fasta">here</A>):</P><PRE CLASS="verbatim">&gt;&gt;&gt; handle = open("m_cold.fasta", "r")
&gt;&gt;&gt; handle.readline()
"&gt;gi|8332116|gb|BE037100.1|BE037100 MP14H09 MP Mesembryanthemum ...\n"
</PRE><P>Handles are regularly used in Biopython for passing information to parsers.</P><!--TOC subsection Creating a handle from a string-->
<H3 CLASS="subsection"><!--SEC ANCHOR --><A NAME="htoc121">9.1.1</A>&#XA0;&#XA0;Creating a handle from a string</H3><!--SEC END --><P>One useful thing is to be able to turn information contained in a
string into a handle. The following example shows how to do this using 
<CODE>cStringIO</CODE> from the Python standard library:</P><PRE CLASS="verbatim">&gt;&gt;&gt; my_info = 'A string\n with multiple lines.'
&gt;&gt;&gt; print my_info
A string
 with multiple lines.
&gt;&gt;&gt; import cStringIO
&gt;&gt;&gt; my_info_handle = cStringIO.StringIO(my_info)
&gt;&gt;&gt; first_line = my_info_handle.readline()
&gt;&gt;&gt; print first_line
A string

&gt;&gt;&gt; second_line = my_info_handle.readline()
&gt;&gt;&gt; print second_line
 with multiple lines.
